Improvements:
----------
* Added the full backdrop image and calculation for popular but broke the screen views.  Need to implement the heterogenous layout/views in the list first [See here:](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView
* Figure out why the ActionBar icon found in the manifest is not showing up.

Done:
-----
* Get click off of the image and into the entire row for the ListView.  However, left code in place on the MovieAdapter since will need to figure out how to handle the click for playing the trailer.

Learning:
----------
* This is still to review: http://guides.codepath.com/android/Constructing-View-Layouts
