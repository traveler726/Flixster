Improvements:
----------
* Added the full backdrop image and calculation for popular but broke the screen views.  Need to implement the heterogenous layout/views in the list first [See here:](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView
* Figure out why the ActionBar icon found in the manifest is not showing up.
* Need to get click off of the image and into the entire row for the ListView.

Learning:
----------
* This is still to review: http://guides.codepath.com/android/Constructing-View-Layouts
